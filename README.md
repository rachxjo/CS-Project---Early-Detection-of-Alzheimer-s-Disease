# CS-Project---Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease
Alzheimer's Disease Prediction and Classification
Imagine forgetting the names of your loved ones, getting lost on familiar streets, or struggling to find the words to finish a sentence. These symptoms, often portrayed in movies and real-life stories, reflect the harsh reality of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurological disorder that slowly erodes memory and cognitive function.

Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, affecting millions worldwide, with numbers expected to rise sharply due to aging populations. Despite its prevalence, diagnosis often happens too late, when cognitive decline has already impaired quality of life and treatment options are limited.

Early detection is not just important. It is vital. It enables patients and families to plan ahead, start treatments earlier, and access support services. Traditionally, diagnosis relies on clinical assessments, cognitive testing, and sometimes invasive or expensive imaging techniques, which are not always accessible or scalable.

This is where artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), holds transformative potential. By analyzing patterns in clinical data and MRI brain scans, these models can assist in identifying Alzheimer’s earlier and more accurately.

In this project, we aim to explore a wide range of ML and DL models from traditional algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and pre-trained architectures like VGG16 — to detect and classify Alzheimer’s stages using structured and image-based data. Our goal is to find reliable, automated solutions that support early diagnosis and advance research in neurodegenerative diseases.
